# flippycoins

Flippy coins is a coin flip simlator where users can flip coins and track their stats such as how many times the coin lands on heads vs tails, how many times they call the flip correctly, and more. 

I have created YouTube tutorials for this entire code base so you can learn to code this website yourself!
